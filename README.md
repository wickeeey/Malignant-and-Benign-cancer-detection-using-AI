# Malignant-and-Benign-cancer-detection-using-AI
Creating an AI model in tensorflow using real life cancer data to predict if the cancer is malignant or benign.  

# Basic Info
Malignant tumors (cancerous) can invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body, whereas benign tumors (non-cancerous) do not spread. This project aims to develop an AI model using supervised machine learning to detect whether a tumor is malignant or benign.
